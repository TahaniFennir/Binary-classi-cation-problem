# Binary-classi-cation-problem
I choosed the dataset [Mammographic masses] which is a public dataset from UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass), to build a classification model that Predicting whether a tumour is benign or malignant from BI-RADS attributes and the patientâ€™s age( binary classification problem).
